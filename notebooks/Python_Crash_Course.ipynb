    "## 1.1 Using Google as a programming tool\n",
    "\n",
    "It might surprise you to learn that one of the most useful tools a programmer has in his or her disposal is the Google search engine. Any programming language has a wealth of features and functions, and it's really difficult and many times impractical to try to remember them all. We can use Google help us find features in Python that will help us code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases you might want to create program, but you can't seem to figure out how to get around a specific problem. By Googling you might find other coders online who has publish the exact code snippet you need. You might think that's _cheating_, but in programming there's a saying: _\"Don't reinvent the wheel.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python website has its own dedicated page documenting the Python features. You can find the website here https://www.python.org/doc/. Note that there are different documentations for different versions of Python. In most cases the documentation will vary little between the different versions, but be careful of this in case you get some strange errors (you might be reading the wrong documentation!). \n",

    "\n",
    "This page you're currently on is called a _Jupyter Notebook_. It's an _interactive Python_ environment, which allows us to experiment with and learn Python in an _interactive_ way. In general _Jupyter_ is what we'd call an _Integrated development environment_ (IDE), a program that enables us to write and run Python programs. There are many different IDEs for any single programming language, with different kinds of advantages for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is quite different other IDEs because it allows us to both write text and code, in the same document. The basic building block of a Jupyter notebook is the _cell_. Code is written in _code cells_ and text is written in _markdown cells_. This, for example, is a text cell. If you try double clicking on the cell, the cell should change into _edit mode_, and you'll be able to edit this text! To go back to displaying the cell normally, press _SHIFT+ENTER_.\n",

    "We will be using Jupyter notebooks to introduce you to simple Python functions that you'll then experiment with in this notebook. Eventually we'll be moving on to another IDE called IDLE."
